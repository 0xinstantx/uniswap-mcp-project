# uniswap-mcp-project

Testing out how MCPs work with Anvil.

## foundry

Just a script to test swapping USDC to ETH on Anvil fork.

## mcp-server

An MCP server with two tools:

1. `get_eth_balance`
2. `swap_eth_for_usdc`

The implementation for `get_eth_balance` is taken from Monad's [tutorial](https://github.com/monad-developers/monad-mcp-tutorial).
